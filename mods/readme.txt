ALE Psych - mods folder
This is the directory where all ALE Psych mods are stored.

If you are new to modding, the easiest way to begin is by extracting "modTemplate.zip". It includes a starter structure that helps you begin developing your mod right away.

Useful resources:
Psych GitHub wiki: https://github.com/ALE-Psych-Crew/ALE-Psych/wiki
Lua Script API: https://github.com/ALE-Psych-Crew/ALE-Psych/blob/main/docs/lua/Home.md

You are not required to use the template. You can create or modify individual files manually, as long as you recreate the correct folder path inside the mods/ directory.

ABOUT EDITING:
If you want to override an existing asset (for example something from assets/shared/images or assets/base_game/images), place your edited version inside mods/images. The engine will automatically load the file from your mod instead of the base game.

Happy modding!
